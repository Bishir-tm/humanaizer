- Term Fortress: Terminology Lock: Allows users to specify keywords and phrases that the humanization engine must not alter, ensuring technical accuracy is maintained.
- Tuning Slider: Strength Control: UI element for users to control the intensity of text modification. Options will include Subtle, Balanced, and Aggressive settings.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL (210, 60%, 50%) translates to a vibrant, but not too saturated, blue (#3385FF), symbolizing trust and intellect.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#F0F8FF), a very pale tint of the primary, offers a gentle, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL (180, 50%, 40%) gives us a muted teal (#339999), which is approximately 30 degrees from the primary and serves to draw the eye.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) provides a modern and readable appearance suitable for academic texts.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different functions (e.g., a magnifying glass for AI Detection, a lock for Terminology Lock).
- A clean, two-panel layout is essential, to allow easy comparison of original to revised text. Focus should be on readability, avoiding clutter.
